  abstract = {Access to primary research data is vital for the advancement of
              science. To extend the data types supported by community
              repositories, we built a prototype Image Data Resource (IDR) that
              collects and integrates imaging data acquired across many
              different imaging modalities. IDR links data from several imaging
              modalities, including high-content screening, super-resolution
              and time-lapse microscopy, digital pathology, public genetic or
              chemical databases, and cell and tissue phenotypes expressed
              using controlled ontologies. Using this integration, IDR
              facilitates the analysis of gene networks and reveals functional
              interactions that are inaccessible to individual studies. To
              enable re-analysis, we also established a computational resource
              based on Jupyter notebooks that allows remote access to the
              entire IDR. IDR is also an open source platform that others can
              use to publish their own image data. Thus IDR provides both a
              novel on-line resource and a software infrastructure that
              promotes and extends publication and re-analysis of scientific
              image data.},

Critically, a common metadata format used in all these vessels can deliver truly findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable bioimaging data.},

  abstract      = {Image stylization aims at applying a reference style to arbitrary input images. A common scenario is one-shot stylization, where only one example is available for each reference style. Recent approaches for one-shot stylization such as JoJoGAN fine-tune a pre-trained StyleGAN2 generator on a single style reference image. However, such methods cannot generate multiple stylizations without fine-tuning a new model for each style separately. In this work, we present a MultiStyleGAN method that is capable of producing multiple different stylizations at once by fine-tuning a single generator. The key component of our method is a learnable transformation module called Style Transformation Network. It takes latent codes as input, and learns linear mappings to different regions of the latent space to produce distinct codes for each style, resulting in a multistyle space. Our model inherently mitigates overfitting since it is trained on multiple styles, hence improving the quality of stylizations. Our method can learn upwards of $120$ image stylizations at once, bringing $8\times$ to $60\times$ improvement in training time over recent competing methods. We support our results through user studies and quantitative results that indicate meaningful improvements over existing methods.},

We analyzed four approaches: Jena with D2RQ, Jena with R2RML, KAON2 and OWL API. In order to highlight the differences between the four approaches, we used a nutrition diagnostics related ontology for the definition of the concepts and of the rules, and a relational database for the storage of the individuals. As performance evaluation, we focused on the time required to map the relational database to the ontology, and the time required to retrieve the information that is inferred about the diagnostics of a number of people. The obtained results show that the best performance in both cases is given by KAON2.},
